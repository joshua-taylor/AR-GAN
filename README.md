### AR-GAN: Adversarial Regularization via Generative Adversarial Networks for Neural Network Training

We present AR-GAN (Adversarial Regularization Generative Adversarial Network), a novel approach that leverages adversarial training to dynamically optimize neural network regularization during training. Unlike traditional dropout methods that apply fixed probability masks, AR-GAN employs a critic network to evaluate the quality of regularization patterns and adaptively generates dropout masks based on training dynamics and network activations. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that AR-GAN achieves superior performance compared to standard warmup-only training, with mean validation accuracies of 88.0% versus 86.7% on synthetic classification tasks. The adversarial regularization mechanism enables more effective feature learning while maintaining appropriate sparsity levels throughout training.
